logbot
======

The (more or less) original TinySpeck IRC logging and reporting bot, written in perl.
Requires POE::Component::IRC and DBD::mysql from CPAN.
Config options are at the top of <code>logbot.pl</code>.
MySQL schema is included in <code>schema.sql</code>.

For a <i>slightly</i> less awful version, I suggest look at <a href="https://github.com/tinyspeck/logbot">logbot</a> in node.
